# SCC-MPPT
An open source solar charge controller (SCC) with maximum power point tracking (MPPT) which can control the power of solar photovoltaic to produce maximum power. This SCC-MPPT is designed for solar low-power applications, such as like wireless sensor network, emergency lamp, and smartphone charger. An Arduino Nano is used as microcontroller unit to run the MPPT algorithm, regulate DC/DC converter, and monitor the solar power.
